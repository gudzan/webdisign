    <h1>Tapenade (Olive Spread)</h1>
    <p>This is a really simple dish to prepare and it's always a big hit at parties. My father recommends:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>"Make this the night before so that the flavors have time to blend. Just bring it up to room temperature
            before you serve it. In the winter, try serving it warm."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 8oz. jar sundried tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 large garlic cloves</li>
        <li>2/3 c. kalamata olives</li>
        <li>1 t. capers</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine tomatoes and garlic in a food processor. Blend until as smooth as possi-ble.</li>
        <li>Add capers and olives. Pulse the motor a few times until they are incorporated, but still retain some
            texture.</li>
        <li>Serve on thin toast rounds with goat cheese and fresh basil garnish (optional).</li>
    </ol>

        <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
        <p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking
            technique called <i>sous vide</i>. In sous vide cooking, you submerge
            the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath
            that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the
            food to be cooked to. In his book,<cite> Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff
            Potter describes it as ultra-low-temperature poaching.</p>
        <p>Next month, we will be serving <b><i>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us
            before November 30.</p>

            if you are pregnant or have immunity issues.</small></p>
